// Problem: Maximal Rectangle. Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
// observation: Constraints are very low as much as 200
// so a solution with O(N^2) will be acceptable

// Main problem: find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
// Approach => can be boiled down to finding
